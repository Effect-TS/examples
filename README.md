# Effect Examples

This repository serves as a centralized location for both examples of how to use Effect in real-world projects as well as templates for quickly bootstrapping projects with Effect.

## Create Effect App

The repository also contains a command-line application called `create-effect-app`, which can be used to bootstrap an example or a template in a single command.

See [the documentation](./packages/create-effect-app/README.md) for more information.
